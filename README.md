Please turn in a flowchart showing the logic of your program.

NOTE: There will be some flexibility on the layout of the web page you will create. Use your creativity but make it look professional.

 

Write the necessary JavaScript included within an HTML page to prompt the user to enter (window.prompt):

Name
Birthday
 

Calculate the current age in years and then write to the document the name concatenated with the Age. You can choose how to display the information (i.e. what tags to use)

 

NOTE: I would suggest that you google "javascript how to calculate age in years" for some examples. Make sure you understand the code you are using!

 

For example, the inputs could be:

Greg Anderson

10/15/2015

 

Output would be:

Greg Anderson is 52 years old

 

Make sure you add comments to the code. Upload the HTML file with the JavaScript to Learning Suite. 

 

NOTE: If you want, you can use an external js file but make sure you zip up that file and the html file for the upload
